							Welcome to my shell game, where funds get funneled <br>
							Under holding companies that prop up the bubble </a><br>
							Caught the bottom on every item offered for sale <br>
							Banks bought them, so now the feds are hot on my trail <br>
							After my loot goes through those loopholes, I pay my taxes <br>
							I'm the cheater when they're the ones who made the brackets? <br>

							data-content="<p>Beachheads are actually dangerous battlegrounds, so feeling safe there wouldn't make too much sense. </p><p>Maybe that adds to the hollowness of this reassurance, suggesting that the beach is actually where the authorities will already be waiting.</p><p>Plus the <b>pistol</b> in the next line &ndash; not something you see every day in white collar crime.</p>" >I'll be safe by sundown at the beachhead</a> <br>
							Pile of folders and a pistol left in the desk <br>

							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>This was the genesis of the verse, as I had this standalone part written a while back just lying around. I decided to build the rest around it. In my head I intended to make it more action-oriented as opposed to the more figurative escape by white collar criminals, but hey. Maybe another time.</p>" >Chased by hordes of tape recorder-waving Watergate reporters <br>
							Listen, I've escaped before, like Jason Bourne, I'm making Dorner <br>

							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>Apart from the straightforward double meaning of going too far, perhaps it was too insensitive, too soon, or even too much of a stretch to reference Christopher Dorner in that earlier line.</p><p>Also, being able to water ski like the Fonz would be a pretty cool retirement/vacation activity.</p>" >

							data-content="<p>The low-end-heavy chant approach was partially inspired by <a href='http://genius.com/2100854'>the hook from an A$AP Ferg song</a>. This was also my first time attempting to actually write and deliver a hook.</p><p>I actually prefer my higher pitch sung vocals that you can hear harmonizing (if you can call it that), but I'm not sure it was good enough to stand by itself. I suppose keeping both the high and low end matches the contrast between light/dark, right/wrong, etc. which we touch on soon.</p><p>Anyway, the lyrics themselves are pretty straightforward.</p><p>Although after hearing it a few times, I noticed a weak potential alternate meaning that could describe the observation of someone, maybe an animal (the ungendered <b>it</b>?) finding self-medication to <b>take</b> to keep itself or its demons on the inside. Okay, I'm not an English major.</p>" >
							Inhale, ingest, imbibe <br>
							Whatever it takes to keep it on the inside <br>
							<br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>I'm trying to rely less on these &quot;paradoxes&quot; but I liked the contradiction here. If I couldn't articulate my self-loathing, then I wouldn't have been able to follow with a long verse on the topic. Yet I did &ndash; so maybe it's not about self-loathing at all.</p>" >
							I'm really lucky that I ain't well spoken <br>
							To the point I could articulate my self-loathing </a><br>
							Hell's frozen? Yeah? I wouldn't know <br>
							If I were there I'd be admiring the snow <br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>I liked the nature/elements theme briefly carried on here (<b>snow, earth, dirt</b>) that kind of transitions from this imaginary (impossible) cold hell to more realistic elements. The traditional idea of hell is fictional and too abstract &ndash; I think it's more interesting to integrate something more relatable.</p>" >
							Unearth my dirt, bring it all to light </a><br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>Just as there was a contrast with the dirt/darkness being revealed in the light, now there's a contrast between wrong and right. We come back to the question raised by the hook: whether supressing/hiding the dirt (especially when under the influence) is a good or a bad thing.</p>" >
							These poisons don't help in mixing wrong and right </a><br>
							I've done enough of covering up <br>
							Just to brush it under the rug <br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>I had a dumb inside joke with some alcoholic folks I used to know that <i>sobriety was the real punishment</i>, as it forced you to confront life 24/7 without any possibility of the escape that substances can easily offer. It was a bit tough articulating this into the verse, but ending with this rhyme scheme sounded good to me.</p>" >
							While that's one way to deal with hardship, suffering <br>
							By being forced to watch is the harshest punishment </a><br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>Reflecting on the past in a sour mood (especially while also drunk/high) sometimes led me to focus on (or even fabricating) some new detail and irreversibly becoming convinced that it was a lot worse than it really was.</p>" >Take your favorite memories and tarnish one of them </a><br>
							Take out all the salt from your jar and rub it in <br>
							En garde, on par with the old you <br>
							Souls move together, march when they go through <br>
							Hand in hand in unison now, moving to the other side <br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>It's actually <b>CliffsNotes</b>, oops. I actually started with the <i>cliff notes couldn't summarize</i> phrase first, then built the two <b>summarize</b> homophones after it.</p><p>Then I liked the imagery of being at the <b>edge</b> of a <b>cliff</b>, which evoked that whole death/transition bit (<b>the other side</b>) even further above.</p><p>Lastly, the <b>climb/decline/rise/fall</b> also ties into the hanging-off-a-cliff idea. You might have more control than you think  over how you deal with things.</p>" >
							Almost dead waiting at the edge asking, "What am I?" <br>
							In quotes &ndash; cliff notes couldn't summarize <br>
							Climb or decline, some'll fall, some'll rise </a><br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>I believe it's not uncommon to treat depression with more vitamin D (especially from sunlight) and increased exposure to the natural outdoors. I know it often helps me when I'm in a slump.</p><p>The <b>runner's high</b> here is both literal (running outdoors can have a strong positive physiological effect on mood) and figurative (it can feel good/exhilarating running from your problems).</p>" >
							You can smile and see the sun in the summer rise <br>
							You can frown but it doesn't hide your runner's high </a><br>
							Strangely you're not so morbid today <br>
							You stopped saying you consider being born a mistake <br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p><b>Take that portal away</b> here has a double meaning:</p><p>There's nowhere left to go if you don't take that portal (e.g. going on a bender) and travel somewhere far away.</p><p>Or, there's nowhere left to go if you don't completely remove that path from your life (e.g. going sober/straight-edge, which will open up new paths in life).</p>" >
							Nowhere left to go if you don't take that portal away </a><br>
							Sobriety is nothing but another form of escape <br>
							<br>
							Inhale, ingest, imbibe <br>

							What if it seems you're on the wayside often? </a><br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>It's very common to go back and analyze the past to see what you can learn, or to try find ways to reproduce success (whether your own or someone else's). Just keep in mind <a href='http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Real-World/narrative.html'>there's a narrative fallacy</a> that's ever-present...</p>" >
							Tempted to trace steps that you take </a><br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>I've seen a lot of people self-sabotage, or somehow end up getting cold feet right before taking the plunge toward something that would've been very good for them.</p><p>Ultimately, if you're brave enough to actually do it, you should accept that this new territory is likely going to be hairy and scary.</p>" >
							Finally here, and now you want to exit the place <br>
							Though all isn't lost, some parts of it are <br>
							You've come far, so now it's uncharted and dark </a><br>
							These kind of thoughts you ought to keep to yourself <br>

							Smile when you look at us... high on a sugar rush <br>
							Guess dollar fries stopped qualifying for good enough <br>

							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>I realized after the fact that this could also be a nod to those Monopoly chance games run by McDonald's. </p>" >
							And monopolize more than McDonald's has lobby ties </a><br>
							The easy job's to hide behind some corporate statements <br>
							That only need checking on a quarterly basis <br>
							Keep the poor on a wait list, they can afford to give patience <br>
							To make a fortune of their own, it's your fortune they play with <br>
							Democratic? That never worked, bring tyrannic back <br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>I have to say for the record that this wordplay was tongue-in-cheek. It's weird building punchlines into an otherwise preachy verse. Anyway, Apple is known for dabbling in proprietary connectors/jacks.</p>" >
							Power standards need to change like Apple Jacks </a><br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>I had Honey Nut Cheerios / other such cereals lying around my rhyme book, and the rest of this entire verse kind of fell in place from there. Why not hit the optional <b>food</b> theme twice in a row?</p>" >
							A tummy tuck for all those Honey Nut Cheerios, <br>
							Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and other such cereals </a><br>
							Build a regime, expose the food pyramid scheme <br>

							I'm the commander in chief, making moves like it's chess <br>
							The real hunger games with layer cakes on paper plates <br>
							Have a meal on the battlefield, my favorite place <br>
							Rations fully stocked, but we are underfed <br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>Oddly enough, this rhyme was the one I found while digging around that formed the verse's starting point (which also conveniently fit the optional <b>food</b> theme of the week).

							Putting peanut butter spread on a piece of Wonder Bread </a><br>
							We'll win in regulation; don't believe in sudden death <br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"

							But if it comes to it I got that secret onion breath </a><br>
							Don't upchuck... I chuck up a juicebox <br>
							Food drops... from above us like moon rocks <br>
							You, stop your clapping game, Patty Cake'll have to wait <br>
							Be productive, please, use those hands to make some patties shaped <br>
							Like perfect circles, transforming ground beef <br>
							Into ammo for our army: this is more than browned meat <br>
							Lean war machine... I'm sure it sounds cheap <br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"

							But we can turn a quarter pound into a porterhouse feast </a><br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>This random rhyme scheme was also a really old one I had lying around. It started with Hamburg/Frankfurt, and I just built around that.</p><p>Oh, I was very pleasantly surprised that Amherst was actually located in a county called Hampshire.</p>" >
							The sources found me: got bratwurst from Hamburg <br>
							Apple wine and sauce from Frankfurt and Antwerp <br>
							Amherst in Hampshire</a> supplies the dairy <br>
							Ask Finland for the lingons and all kinds of berries <br>
							We can fight until winter break, call a truce <br>
							Then break it in a raid for their Minute Maid orange juice <br>
							I'm proud of all my troops, strapped up, boots laced <br>

							data-content="<p>I badly wanted to integrate <b>plastic trays</b> into the rhyme scheme earlier (<i>Patty Cake'll have to wait ...</i>) but I couldn't really work it in smoothly, so I just mentioned trays later on here.</p>" >
							Plastic spoons, trays</a> in hand with fruit cakes <br>
							I led them to victory in my grammar school days <br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>Not sure this belongs here, but I had a few concepts that didn't make the cut (no pun intended), like playing off the combat-oriented double meanings possible with <b>shank</b> and <b>flank</b>. Also burger flippers / burn their fingers.</p>" >
