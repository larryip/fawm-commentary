							data-content="<p>First date anxiety at the movies.</p><p>Like Arnold from The Magic School Bus, I knew I should've stayed home today.</p>">
							Down the aisle, looked to my left<br/>
							I think staying home today would've been best </a><br/>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>I go out of my way to trouble the other moviegoers just to get her what she wants. And it's only the first date!</p>">
							She likes sitting in the middle, so I gave her<br/>
							What she wanted, stepping over strangers </a><br/>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>It's literally dark during this time, which echos the figurative darkness: the scary (exciting?) unknown of another person. Soon, the light will come and reveal more, don't worry.</p><p>Exchanging simple likes and dislikes is a rather superficial (although common) way to try to get to know someone. Here, we don't even get the luxury of dislikes: all we have are the positives and likely empty agreements just for the sake of feeling connected.</p>">
							Lights dim a bit, here come the previews<br/>
							Here come the "I like it"s and the "me too"s </a><br/>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>Aren't we supposed to be getting acquainted?</p>">
							Don't look at me, keep your head straight </a><br/>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>I had originally written the closer as:</p><p><i>Hope you don't look at me, keep your head straight<br/>Hope to see you on our next date</i></p><p>...but Dean suggested that it felt too passive, negative, and pathetic!</p>">
							See you on our next date </a><br/>
							<br/>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>Skipping past the line of faceless people who didn't make a reservation. And maybe stumbling between other diners' chairs, oops.</p>">
							Down the aisle, looked to my left<br/>
							I think staying home today would've been best<br/>
							She likes 'talian cuisine, so I gave her<br/>
							What she wanted, stepping over strangers </a><br/>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>Compared to the darkness of the movie theater, now we can kind of actually see each other...</p>">
							Lights barely on, here comes the menu </a><br/>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>Kind of sarcastic, but kind of not &ndash; it's just a dinner date and we're already jumping the gun here even though the conversation is extremely mundane and expected.</p><p>I had originally written the closer as:</p><p><i>Hope you really get me<br/>Hope to see you next week</i></p><p>...but again, the repetition of <b>hope</b> painted a much more pessimistic picture. Plus, the desire to be understood was too explicit, and a bit out of place given the song's primary focus on the girl.</p>">
							Here come all her comments on the venue<br/>
							Your voice is so soothing<br/>
							When will you move in? </a><br/>
							<br/>
							My girl<br/>
							Me and her we're gonna run the world<br/>
							We're already marathoning season four<br/>
							If she likes we'll get married by the shore<br/>
							<br/>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>This time, we're again swimming through a crowd of faceless strangers, bumbling through a Whole Paycheck looking for some obscure health food that she demands to have.</p>">
							Down the aisle, looked to my left<br/>
							I think staying home today would've been best<br/>
							She likes organic soy milk, so I gave her<br/>
							What she wanted, stepping over strangers </a><br/>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>In this supermarket, the lights are much brighter than they were in the movie theater or romantic restaraunt. On the figurative side, it's becoming clear what kind of relationship this is, and the absurdity of going through all this trouble for a girl I don't even know that well.</p>">
							Lights shining</a>, <a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>Everyone else in this story except the girl might as well not exist, as they're just cynically written off as boring drones.</p>">here comes the cashier<br/>
							Here come the same jokes for the past year </a><br/>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>Is this even the right brand of soy milk? Maybe it was almond milk.</p><p>Somehow we already have plans to meet the parents? That was fast.</p><p>I had originally written the last line as:</p><p><i>Hope to meet your parents</i></p><p>...but again, that didn't quite fit the narrative as well, now that we were proactively depicting this whole relationship-going-places-on-paper-but-not-in-reality idea.</p>">
							Hope it suits your palate<br/>
							Hope you like my parents </a><br/>
							<br/>
							Down the aisle, looked to my left<br/>
							I think staying home today would've been best<br/>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>Here we are on the big day. An outdoors wedding, like the one we touched on in the first hook.</p><p>Who are all these people? Friends? Her family and coworkers?</p>">
							She likes paper bouquets, so I gave her<br/>
							What she wanted, stepping over strangers </a><br/>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>The light is blinding now. Accordingly, it's completely obvious at this point that the relationship doesn't mean much whatsoever to the narrator. It's literally in your face, and you're forced to confront how ridiculous this entire ordeal is.</p>At least there's some delicious food.</p>">
							Sun in my eyes, here comes the crab cake </a><br/>
							Here come all the smiles and the handshakes<br/>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>We come full circle &ndash; ironically, from an obsession with the girl (resulting in a blindness to other humans, even those sitting mere inches way) to a final, brief flash of self-consciousness.</p><p>I had originally written the closer as:</p><p><i>Hope it goes fast<br/>Hope it won't last</i></p><p>But I think this was hitting the pessimism in a way that was too straightforward. It works better with more subtle imagery, with the added bonus of hinting at the honeymoon.</p>">
							Hope you still like me<br/>
							When we're in Hawaii </a><br/>
							<br/>
							My girl<br/>
							Me and her we're gonna run the world<br/>
							Already bought more than we can afford<br/>
							Can't wait to see what else lies in store<br/>

							Welcome to my shell game, where funds get funneled <br>
							Under holding companies that prop up the bubble </a><br>
							Caught the bottom on every item offered for sale <br>
							Banks bought them, so now the feds are hot on my trail <br>
							After my loot goes through those loopholes, I pay my taxes <br>
							I'm the cheater when they're the ones who made the brackets? <br>

							Asked my lawyer 'bout my paranoia, he said <br>
							If I fly out now then <a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>Beachheads are actually dangerous battlegrounds, so feeling safe there wouldn't make too much sense. </p><p>Maybe that adds to the hollowness of this reassurance, suggesting that the beach is actually where the authorities will already be waiting.</p><p>Plus the <b>pistol</b> in the next line &ndash; not something you see every day in white collar crime.</p>" >I'll be safe by sundown at the beachhead</a> <br>
							Pile of folders and a pistol left in the desk <br>
							Seeing silhouettes got me feeling Nixon-esque <br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>This was the genesis of the verse, as I had this standalone part written a while back just lying around. I decided to build the rest around it. In my head I intended to make it more action-oriented as opposed to the more figurative escape by white collar criminals, but hey. Maybe another time.</p>" >Chased by hordes of tape recorder-waving Watergate reporters <br>
							Listen, I've escaped before, like Jason Bourne, I'm making Dorner <br>
							Look like an amateur,</a> running's an art <br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>Apart from the straightforward double meaning of going too far, perhaps it was too insensitive, too soon, or even too much of a stretch to reference Christopher Dorner in that earlier line.</p><p>Also, being able to water ski like the Fonz would be a pretty cool retirement/vacation activity.</p>" >

							data-content="<p>The low-end-heavy chant approach was partially inspired by <a href='http://genius.com/2100854'>the hook from an A$AP Ferg song</a>. This was also my first time attempting to actually write and deliver a hook.</p><p>I actually prefer my higher pitch sung vocals that you can hear harmonizing (if you can call it that), but I'm not sure it was good enough to stand by itself. I suppose keeping both the high and low end matches the contrast between light/dark, right/wrong, etc. which we touch on soon.</p><p>Anyway, the lyrics themselves are pretty straightforward.</p><p>Although after hearing it a few times, I noticed a weak potential alternate meaning that could describe the observation of someone, maybe an animal (the ungendered <b>it</b>?) finding self-medication to <b>take</b> to keep itself or its demons on the inside. Okay, I'm not an English major.</p>" >
							Inhale, ingest, imbibe <br>
							Whatever it takes to keep it on the inside <br>
							<br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>I'm trying to rely less on these &quot;paradoxes&quot; but I liked the contradiction here. If I couldn't articulate my self-loathing, then I wouldn't have been able to follow with a long verse on the topic. Yet I did &ndash; so maybe it's not about self-loathing at all.</p>" >
							I'm really lucky that I ain't well spoken <br>
							To the point I could articulate my self-loathing </a><br>
							Hell's frozen? Yeah? I wouldn't know <br>
							If I were there I'd be admiring the snow <br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>I liked the nature/elements theme briefly carried on here (<b>snow, earth, dirt</b>) that kind of transitions from this imaginary (impossible) cold hell to more realistic elements. The traditional idea of hell is fictional and too abstract &ndash; I think it's more interesting to integrate something more relatable.</p>" >
							Unearth my dirt, bring it all to light </a><br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>Just as there was a contrast with the dirt/darkness being revealed in the light, now there's a contrast between wrong and right. We come back to the question raised by the hook: whether supressing/hiding the dirt (especially when under the influence) is a good or a bad thing.</p>" >
							These poisons don't help in mixing wrong and right </a><br>
							I've done enough of covering up <br>
							Just to brush it under the rug <br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>I had a dumb inside joke with some alcoholic folks I used to know that <i>sobriety was the real punishment</i>, as it forced you to confront life 24/7 without any possibility of the escape that substances can easily offer. It was a bit tough articulating this into the verse, but ending with this rhyme scheme sounded good to me.</p>" >
							While that's one way to deal with hardship, suffering <br>
							By being forced to watch is the harshest punishment </a><br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>Reflecting on the past in a sour mood (especially while also drunk/high) sometimes led me to focus on (or even fabricating) some new detail and irreversibly becoming convinced that it was a lot worse than it really was.</p>" >Take your favorite memories and tarnish one of them </a><br>
							Take out all the salt from your jar and rub it in <br>
							En garde, on par with the old you <br>
							Souls move together, march when they go through <br>
							Hand in hand in unison now, moving to the other side <br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>It's actually <b>CliffsNotes</b>, oops. I actually started with the <i>cliff notes couldn't summarize</i> phrase first, then built the two <b>summarize</b> homophones after it.</p><p>Then I liked the imagery of being at the <b>edge</b> of a <b>cliff</b>, which evoked that whole death/transition bit (<b>the other side</b>) even further above.</p><p>Lastly, the <b>climb/decline/rise/fall</b> also ties into the hanging-off-a-cliff idea. You might have more control than you think  over how you deal with things.</p>" >
							Almost dead waiting at the edge asking, "What am I?" <br>
							In quotes &ndash; cliff notes couldn't summarize <br>
							Climb or decline, some'll fall, some'll rise </a><br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p>I believe it's not uncommon to treat depression with more vitamin D (especially from sunlight) and increased exposure to the natural outdoors. I know it often helps me when I'm in a slump.</p><p>The <b>runner's high</b> here is both literal (running outdoors can have a strong positive physiological effect on mood) and figurative (it can feel good/exhilarating running from your problems).</p>" >
							You can smile and see the sun in the summer rise <br>
							You can frown but it doesn't hide your runner's high </a><br>
							Strangely you're not so morbid today <br>
							You stopped saying you consider being born a mistake <br>
							<a href="#" class="show-pop right" data-placement="right"  
							data-content="<p><b>Take that portal away</b> here has a double meaning:</p><p>There's nowhere left to go if you don't take that portal (e.g. going on a bender) and travel somewhere far away.</p><p>Or, there's nowhere left to go if you don't completely remove that path from your life (e.g. going sober/straight-edge, which will open up new paths in life).</p>" >
							Nowhere left to go if you don't take that portal away </a><br>
							Sobriety is nothing but another form of escape <br>
